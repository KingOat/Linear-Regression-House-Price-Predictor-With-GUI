# Linear Regression House Price Predictor

This project implements a linear regression-based house price predictor with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library for GUI development and the Keras library for machine learning. The project allows users to input features of a house, such as square footage, number of rooms, etc., and predicts the estimated price of the house based on the trained linear regression model.

## Features

- Linear regression-based house price prediction
- Graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter library
- User-friendly input form for entering house features
- Real-time prediction of house price based on input features
- Easy-to-understand visualizations of the trained linear regression model

## Requirements

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Keras (2.4.0 or higher)
- tkinter (included in Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip.

## Usage
1. Launch the application and the GUI will be displayed.
2. Enter the features of the house, such as square footage, number of rooms, etc., in the input form.
3. Click the "Predict" button to see the estimated price of the house based on the trained linear regression model.
4. he application also provides visualizations of the trained model, such as scatter plots and regression line, for better understanding.

```bash
pip install keras
